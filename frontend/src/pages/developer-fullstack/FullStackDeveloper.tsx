When using React and Node.js together, you create a **MERN Stack** project. For the database, using MongoDB with Mongoose not only speeds up development but also ensures secure and efficient NoSQL solutions. Statistics show that Node.js and React are among the most widely used technologies globally. üöÄ üçî‚ú®
